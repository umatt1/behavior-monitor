## Why This Exists

When you're in a confusing or emotionally intense relationship, your memory can become less reliable. You might question what really happened, doubt your own experiences, or lose track of patterns that are obvious in hindsight.

This tool exists to help you see clearly—not to tell you what to see, but to help you notice what's actually there. Think of it as a journal that shows you the bigger picture.
